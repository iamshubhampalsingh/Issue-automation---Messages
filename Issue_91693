Test Case title: Automating Script for Camera Interface Identification in order to rectify lag issue.

Preconditions:
•	Sim cards should be inserted.
•	Google photos app should be updated. 

Automation Script Steps:
1.	Create Device Object.
2.	Interact with Camera App.
3.	Initialize Counters: Initialize counters to keep track of how many times the camera interface is identified or not identified in the loop.
4.	Loop 10 Times.
5.	Print Counts: Print the counts of identified and not identified instances after the loop.
6.	Go Back in the System UI.

Expected Results:
1.	The script will attempt to open the Camera interface on the Android device.
2.	It will then try to identify the Camera interface by checking the existence of a specific UI element related to the Google Photos app.
3.	The script will repeat this process in a loop for 10 iterations.
4.	After the loop, it will print the counts of how many times the Camera interface was identified and how many times it was not identified.

Automation script outcome for above test case:
import uiautomator2 as ui2
import time

# Device serial number
device_serial = "192.168.2.185:5555"

# Create a Device object for the device
receiver_device = ui2.Device(device_serial)

receiver_device.xpath('//*[@text="Camera"]').click()
time.sleep(2)
receiver_device.xpath('//*[@resource-id="com.android.camera:id/shutter_button"]').click()
time.sleep(3)
receiver_device(resourceId="com.android.camera:id/rounded_thumbnail_view").click()

# Initialize counters
identified_count = 0
not_identified_count = 0

# Loop 10 times
for i in range(1, 11):
    if receiver_device(resourceId="com.google.android.apps.photos:id/video_player_controller_fragment_container").exists():
        print(f"Camera interface identified in iteration {i}")
        identified_count += 1
        
    else:
        print(f"Camera interface not identified in iteration {i}")
        not_identified_count += 1
       
    # Introduce a delay between iterations if needed
    time.sleep(2)

# Print the counts after the loop
print(f"Camera interface identified {identified_count} times")
print(f"Camera interface not identified {not_identified_count} times")
time.sleep(2)
receiver_device(resourceId="com.android.systemui:id/back").click()
time.sleep(2)
receiver_device(resourceId="com.android.systemui:id/back").click()

Conclusion:

1.	The script identified count and not identified count provide insights into the success or failure of the Camera interface detection during the iterations.
2.	We can use the basic coding of this script to identify lagging issues for other application or module by using loop method.
